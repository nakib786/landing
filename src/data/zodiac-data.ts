        overview: `
<p>Taurus, ruled by Venus and symbolized by the Bull, is the second sign of the zodiac and the anchor of stability, comfort, and sensuality. As an Earth sign with fixed modality, Taurus grounds the chaotic energy of Aries and brings patience, persistence, and structure to the world. Known for their calm demeanor and soothing presence, Taurus individuals exude an aura of quiet strength. They move through life with a sense of purpose, valuing consistency over chaos, and steady progression over sudden leaps.</p>
<p>Venus, the planet of love, beauty, pleasure, and values, shapes Taurus’ worldview more deeply than any other sign. Taureans naturally appreciate the finer things in life—good food, soft fabrics, nature, music, and anything that awakens the senses. Their connection to physical comfort is not superficial; it’s spiritual. Through physical pleasure and earthly beauty, Taurus connects to a sense of inner peace and stability.</p>
<p>But beneath their serene exterior lies immense power. Like the Bull, Taurus is strong, loyal, and unmovable once committed. They are deeply protective of their loved ones, their routines, and their values. When Taurus decides to build something—whether a career, relationship, home, or personal goal—they do so with dedication and resilience. They aren’t impulsive; they are strategic and steady.</p>
<p>Taurus may seem slow to act, but that’s because they evaluate carefully. Their patient nature allows them to avoid unnecessary risks and build long-lasting success. And once they start something, they rarely quit. Taurus energy represents endurance, grounded wisdom, and the ability to build a beautiful, meaningful life brick by brick.</p>

<p>Cancer, symbolized by the Crab and ruled by the Moon, is the fourth sign of the zodiac. As a cardinal water sign, Cancer represents emotional depth, intuition, nurturing, and protective energy. Those born under Cancer are deeply connected to their emotions, the emotions of others, and the cycles of life. Like the tides governed by the Moon, Cancer’s moods ebb and flow, reflecting their profound sensitivity and intuitive nature.</p>

They may retreat inward when hurt or stressed, but their loyalty and love for family and friends are unwavering.</p>
<p>Cancers combine intuition, sensitivity, and emotional intelligence with a practical sense of caretaking, making them deeply supportive partners, friends, and family members.
